# 🚌 Bus Booking System (Java Console Application)

## 📖 Description
The **Bus Booking System** is a console-based Java application that simulates a real-world bus ticket booking experience.  
It allows users to **register, log in, select routes, view seat availability, and book tickets** while following **gender-based seat restrictions**.  
Each route has its own seat layout, and bookings are managed efficiently through a 3D array structure.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **core Java concepts** such as classes, objects, arrays, loops, conditional statements, and file handling.
